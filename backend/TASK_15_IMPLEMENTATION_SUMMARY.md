- Excludes: migrations, settings, test files

## Additional Implementation Features

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Setup Script**: `backend/setup_testing.py`
- **Comprehensive Test Runner**: `backend/run_comprehensive_tests.py`
- **Implementation Validator**: `backend/validate_implementation.py`

### Test Data Management

- **Scenario Creation**: Realistic test scenarios with relationships
- **Performance Data**: Large datasets for load testing

### Documentation Automation
- **Auto-generation**: Automated API documentation from code
- **OpenAPI Spec**: Machine-readable API specification
- **Test Reports**: Automated test result reporting

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Setup testing environment (first time)
python setup_testing.py

# Run comprehensive test suite
python run_comprehensive_tests.py

# Run specific test types
pytest -m unit                    # Unit tests
pytest -m integration            # Integration tests  
pytest -m performance           # Performance tests

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run load tests
locust -f test_performance_load.py --host=http://localhost:8000

# Validate implementation
python validate_implementation.py
```
