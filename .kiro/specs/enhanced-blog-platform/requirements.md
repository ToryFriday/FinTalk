# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced FinTalk Platform builds upon the existing FinTalk financial blog management system to add comprehensive user management, role-based access control (RBAC), email subscriptions, content moderation, multimedia support, and social features. This enhancement transforms FinTalk from a basic CRUD blog system into a full-featured financial content platform with community engagement and advanced publishing capabilities.
