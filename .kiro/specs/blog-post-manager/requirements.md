# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Full-Stack Blog Post Manager is a comprehensive web application that enables users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts through an intuitive interface. The system consists of a React.js frontend providing a smooth user experience, a Django REST Framework backend offering robust API endpoints, and a PostgreSQL database ensuring reliable data storage. The application emphasizes modern development practices including containerization, comprehensive testing, and clean architecture principles.

4. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and keep the post visible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation between different pages, so that I can efficiently manage blog posts without page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL implement React Router for client-side routing
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL update the URL without full page reloads
3. WHEN the user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate correctly between pages
4. WHEN accessing a direct URL THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate page component

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust backend API, so that the frontend can reliably perform CRUD operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/posts/ THEN the system SHALL create a new blog post and return 201 status
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/posts/ THEN the system SHALL return all posts with 200 status
3. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/posts/{id}/ THEN the system SHALL return the specific post with 200 status
4. WHEN a PUT request is made to /api/posts/{id}/ THEN the system SHALL update the post and return 200 status
5. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /api/posts/{id}/ THEN the system SHALL delete the post and return 204 status
6. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 4xx status codes with error details

### Requirement 8

5. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be containerized, so that it can be easily deployed and scaled across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria
